# User Management System

A simple user management application built with React, React Router, and Axios. It allows you to add, edit, and delete user details such as first name, last name, email, and department. The data is simulated using JSONPlaceholder API for the sake of development.

## Features:
- **Home page**: Displays a list of all users with the option to add, edit, or delete users.
- **Add User**: A form to add new users to the system.
- **Edit User**: A form to edit existing users' details.
- **Error Handling**: Includes an `ErrorBoundary` to catch any errors in the app and display a fallback UI.
